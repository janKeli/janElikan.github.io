I believe [it is implemented now](https://github.com/janKeli/lipu/tree/c2f4e6a2a1b093fa2bc474c92a4399f0d673a27e), or at least a minimal version of it. Clippy is not happy, but what I want right now is a *working prototype*, which I can refactor later. So I'm switching over to the front-end side of things.

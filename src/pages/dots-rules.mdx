Requirements for each machine:
- all *perephirals must be wired*
- *no remote access* except for the server
- *no closed-source services* that have *full access to hardware* (e.g. google assistant)
  - exception: phone vendor's kernel
- all devices can be *set up* either fully or semi-*automatically* using the [dots repo](https://github.com/janKeli/dots) (i.e. no snowflakes)
- the *OS* has to be able to *heal itself* to a point, no system reinstalls

Data:
- the vault is as public/transparent as possible
- all important data is stored in one directory
- that directory is synced across all devices
- compressed, encrypted and backed up weekly

Physical machines:
- workstation <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona suli</span>
- mobile computer <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona tawa</span>
- server, optional

Virtual machines:
- can follow the requirements if they are trusted
- are considered temporary, disposable if they don't

Containers are not treated as machines and do not have to follow these.

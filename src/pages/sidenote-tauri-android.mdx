    Make cool apps! 🌻 🐕 🎉
```

Victory indeed, considering that I've spent the last 128 minutes trying to get it to work!

oh wait, I forgot something:
```
Please set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the
location of your Java installation.

    Error Failed to assemble APK: command ["/nix/persist/repos/tauri-playground/tauri-app/src-tauri/gen/android/gradlew", "--project-dir", "/nix/persist/repos/tauri-playground/tauri-app/src-tauri/gen/android"] exited with code 1: command ["/nix/persist/repos/tauri-playground/tauri-app/src-tauri/gen/android/gradlew", "--project-dir", "/nix/persist/repos/tauri-playground/tauri-app/src-tauri/gen/android"] exited with code 1
```

Fixed that, ran it again and now it hang. I think it's okay, that's probably gradle being slow (?)

I'm not very good with ~~plants~~ android and java tooling.

```
* What went wrong:
Could not determine the dependencies of task ':app:compileArm64DebugJavaWithJavac'.
> Failed to install the following SDK components:
      platforms;android-34 Android SDK Platform 34
  The SDK directory is not writable (/nix/store/ag3w2qik8hwb7wbf0bdxdwfjx3z0akd6-androidsdk/libexec/android-sdk)
```

(error about `aapt2` omitted)

now I need [dynamic linking](https://github.com/0atman/noboilerplate/blob/main/scripts/38-nixos.md#ld-fix)... Oh, wait, [no I don't, it's just the dependencies](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Android#gradlew)

Finally! I'll publish the gist on 2024-08-10
